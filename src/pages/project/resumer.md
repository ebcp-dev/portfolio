### Personal Project (2020)

Link: [Resumer.xyz](https://resumer.xyz/)

I primarily started on this project in order to learn how to use ag-Grid as it is a popular data table library.

A full stack web app where users can create profiles and keep track of their
job applications. Powered by an Express REST API and a PostgreSQL database on Amazon
RDS.

The user interface was developed with React, Redux, Axios and styled with Bulma. Passport.js handles authentication with JSON Web Tokens.

This application uses agâ€‘Grid to display the user's jobs in an interactive data table. Chart.js is used to display job application statistics.

Tested using Mocha, Chai and deployed with continuous integration using Travis CI.
